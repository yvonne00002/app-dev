The Japanese series movie *Erased* is based on a popular manga and anime. It tells the story of Satoru Fujinuma, a man with a special ability called "Revival." This power allows him to go back in time and prevent disasters. When his mother is murdered, Satoru is sent back 18 years to his childhood, just before a series of kidnappings and murders took place. He must try to solve the mystery and save the lives of his friends, including a girl named Kayo, who was one of the victims.

The movie is a mix of mystery, thriller, and time travel. It explores themes like friendship, guilt, and second chances. The story keeps viewers on edge as Satoru tries to figure out who is responsible for the crimes and how to stop them.

The movie is loved for its emotional depth, strong characters, and suspenseful plot. It has a loyal fan base, and it was praised for capturing the essence of the original manga and anime, even though it condenses the story into a film format.

*Erased* is not just about time travel but also about the importance of making the right choices and how the past affects the future.
